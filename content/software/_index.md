Our software teams work in Java to code our robots.

When recruiting new members, we try to give them the basics of coding before build season starts. To do this we like to do a few workshops with them to build their since of coding logic and syntax. A few websites are very helpful with this, one of them being [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java). This gives a basic overview, enough to get them to start understanding the language so that they can work on robot code. Most of the learning happens while working on the robot itself. The best way to gain a better understanding of the language is to write it! Whether it be a simple if statement or a complex subsystem, writing the code solidifies the concepts of Java.
