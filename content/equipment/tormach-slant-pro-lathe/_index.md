## Purpose
Lathes utilize rotational motion to remove material from a work piece. On a lathe, the workpiece rotates and the cutting tool is stationary. By manipulating the position of the tool along the machines 2 working axes (X and Z), material is removed from the workpiece and it is brought to the desired size and shape. This particular milling machine is a computer numerical control (CNC) lathe; G-code can be loaded onto the controller so that the machine can execute complex and simultaneous motion of the machines working axes. This simplifies manufacturing of parts with greater complexity, ensures repeatability, and is highly efficient.
